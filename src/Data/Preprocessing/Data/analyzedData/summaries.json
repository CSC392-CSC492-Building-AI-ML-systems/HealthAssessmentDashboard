Regorafenib is only given when patients have stage IV disease and only in cases of significant disease progression, regardless of symptoms. Regorafenib can be discontinued due to obvious disease progression not amenable to local therapies like surgery or radiation, and intolerable side effects like hand-foot syndrome and mucositis. Dose modification is possible in the setting of toxicity that exceeds grade 3/4 without any documented impact on efficacy."
