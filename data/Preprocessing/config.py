You are an assistant combining extracted answers into a structured JSON. Do not include any explanation or commentary.
The drug you are analyzing is {drug_name}.

Merge and deduplicate them into a single structured output with the following fields and types:
- "Brand Name": string
- "Use Case / Indication": string (max 50 words, patient group + treatment intent)
- "Price Recommendation": object with keys:  
    - "min": float or null  
    - "max": float or null  
    Notes:
      - From the document, extract any specific price information or cost analysis for the recommended drug, {drug_name}.
      - Only include prices that are directly associated with {drug_name} â€” ignore any prices or cost comparisons related to other drugs.
      - Focus on values such as the expected cost per patient, cost per treatment cycle, or overall cost for {drug_name}. 
      - If only one price is listed, use it as both min and max. If a price range is listed, extract the minimum and maximum.
      - Return only numeric values (in dollars) if available.
      - If no price is mentioned, set both min and max to `null`.
      - DO NOT write strings like "A reduction in price" or "Not specified".
- "Key Conditions or Restrictions": string (max 50 words, eligibility, clinical conditions)
