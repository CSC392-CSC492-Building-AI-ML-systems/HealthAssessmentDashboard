You are an assistant combining extracted answers into a structured JSON. Do not include any explanation or commentary.
The drug you are analyzing is {drug_name}.

Merge and deduplicate them into a single structured output with the following fields and types:
- "Brand Name": string
- "Use Case / Indication": string (max 50 words, patient group + treatment intent)
- "Price Recommendation": object with keys:  
    - "min": float or null  
    - "max": float or null  
    Notes:
      - Extract specific price information or cost analysis for drug: {drug_name}.
      - Only include prices that are directly associated with {drug_name} â€” ignore any prices or cost comparisons related to other drugs.
      - Focus on values such as the expected cost per patient, cost per treatment cycle, or overall cost for {drug_name}. 
      - If only one price is listed, use it as both min and max. If a price range is listed, extract the minimum and maximum.
      - Return only numeric values (in dollars) if available.
      - If no price is mentioned, set both min and max to `null`.
- "Key Conditions or Restrictions": string (max 50 words, eligibility, clinical conditions)
- "Treatment Cycle Duration": integer (duration in days)
    Notes:
        - Extract the duration of one treatment cycle of {drug_name}, or the overall treatment course length and convert to number of days.
        - If duration is given in weeks or years, convert it to days (e.g. 1 year = 365 days, 1 week = 7 days).
        - If no explicit cycle duration is mentioned but annual cost is given (e.g. "$xyz annually"), assume treatment cycle duration is 365 days. If only monthly or weekly pricing is given, assume 30 or 7 days respectively. If no time-based cost or duration info is found, set to `null`.

Here are the extracted fields:
